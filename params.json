{"name":"SeqMule","tagline":"Automated human exome/genome variants detection","body":"# SeqMule: Automated human exome/genome variants detection\r\n\r\nSeqMule takes single-end or paird-end FASTQ or BAM files, generates a script consisting of more than 10 popular alignment, analysis tools and runs the script line by line. Users can change the pipeline or fine-tune the parameters by modifying its configuration file. SeqMule also has some built-in functions, such as pooling consensus calls from various callers, plotting a Venn diagram showing intersection among different callers, and downloading databases.\r\n\r\n## Synopsis\r\n\r\n* **seqmule download**: download databases/BEDs that are required by sequence alignment or variant calling software tools\r\n\r\n* **seqmule pipeline**: perform the automated pipeline for detection of variants from whole-exome/genome data\r\n\r\n* **seqmule stats**: perform statistical analysis of variants data, such as drawing Venn diagram to examine overlap between VCF files, generating union/consensus ca\r\nlls, generating coverage/alignment statistics in specific genomic regions, calculating Mendelian error rates\r\n\r\n* **seqmule run**: continue run from last executed step after interruption or run from a specific step\r\n\r\n* **seqmule update**: perform automated update of the SeqMule software tools\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Multiple aligners\r\n\r\n   BWA-MEM, BWA-BACKTRACK, Bowtie, Bowtie2, SOAP2, SNAP\r\n\r\n* Multiple variant callers\r\n\r\n   GATK, SAMtools, VarScan, SOAPsnp, Freebayes are available.\r\n\r\n   As stated on 1000 Genomes Project website, genotypes obtained through a consensus procedure are estimated to have 30% fewer errors than those generated by any single caller. \r\n\r\n   As we have demonstrated in a previous study (O'Rawe et al. *Genome Med* 2013, **5**:28), consensus calls from multiple calling algorithms may increase calling accuracy and reduce Mendelian error rates.\r\n\r\n* Easy downloading and installation.\r\n\r\n   Most jobs can be done with one-line command.\r\n\r\n* Fast and easy customization\r\n\r\n   Just change the 'advanced_config' file!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* R\r\n* Perl\r\n* Java\r\n\r\n## More information\r\n\r\n* [SeqMule Homepage](http://seqmule.usc.edu)\r\n\r\n* [Wang Genomics Lab Homepage](http://genomics.usc.edu)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-58410868-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
